# Salary Prediction Track

## Project Description

The "Salary Prediction" project involves applying linear regression models to predict values on unknown data. The key aspects include:

1. Fitting a simple model with one predictor and evaluating its performance.
2. Applying scikit-learn library for linear models and predictions.
3. Model comparison and selection.
4. Testing for data issues, specifically multicollinearity.
5. Polynomial feature engineering to handle complex relationships.
6. Multiple linear regression with many independent variables.
7. Checking and improving model performance by analyzing correlations.
8. Addressing negative predictions and assessing their impact.

## Coding Style

Adhere to the PEP 8 coding style guidelines:

- Use clear and meaningful variable names.
- Include comments for complex sections.
- Follow proper indentation and spacing.
- Ensure a clean and readable codebase.

## Libraries Used

The project primarily utilizes the following libraries:

- **scikit-learn:** For implementing linear regression models.
- **pandas:** Handling data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing.
- **matplotlib:** Creating visualizations for model evaluation.
- **seaborn:** Enhancing the aesthetics of visualizations.
